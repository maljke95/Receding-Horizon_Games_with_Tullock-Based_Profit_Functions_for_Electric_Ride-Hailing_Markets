# Receding-Horizon Games with Tullock-Based Profit Functions for Electric Ride-Hailing Markets

**The 63rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC 2024)**, Milan, Italy, 16-19 December 2024

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a receding-horizon, game-
theoretic charging planning mechanism for electric ride-hailing
markets. As the demand for ride-hailing services continues
to surge and governments advocate for stricter environmental
regulations, integrating electric vehicles into these markets
becomes inevitable. The proposed framework addresses the
challenges posed by dynamic demand patterns, fluctuating
energy costs, and competitive dynamics inherent in such
markets. Leveraging the concept of receding-horizon games,
we propose a method to optimize proactive dispatching of
vehicles for recharging over a predefined time horizon. We
integrate a modified Tullock contest that accounts for customer
abandonment due to long waiting times to model the expected
market share, and by factoring in the demand-based electricity
charging, we construct a game capturing interactions between
two companies over the time horizon. For this game, we first
establish the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium
and then present a semi-decentralized, iterative method to
compute it. Finally, the method is evaluated in an open-loop
and a closed-loop manner in a simulated numerical case study.
